            <h3> About the Project </h3>

           <p> The project coordinated by InnoEnergy will design, develop and test a new cloud-based battery management system (A-BMS) to enable the provision of services to end-users and energy companies. The project aims to optimize the management of distributed batteries by exploring and combining multiple flexibility services to obtain the highest financial return. In the projects demonstration phase batteries with a capacity of 10-50kwh will be installed in 3-6 apartment buildings in the city of Örebro. The provision of frequency regulation to SvK will furthermore be tested by aggregating a total of 100kWp flexibility. The project will be conducted in a time period of two years, starting December 2016

<h3> Motivation </h3>

<p> The project is expected to:

Contribute with new knowledge about technical and business solutions for a whole new typ of actor and for new system solutions that both benefit an increased flexibility in the electricity system and that in long term enable new services from local energy storages to be commercialized
Create new possibilities to both generate valuable services to the end-user, building owner and grid operator by a new actor, a local system operator, that is responsible for operations and implementing the local building grid
Contribute to lowering the barriers for new technical solutions to be tested and integrated at end-user by efficient packaging

The innovation is assessed as good through the creation of a technical system and a new local energy actor that enables new business models and increased system values

<h3> Goals </h3>

<p> -Verification of required IT infrastructure including collection of status data from batteries, control signals for
activation of charging and discharging, and data communication through cloud platform
- Verification of technical pre-qualification for the provision of FCR-N frequency regulation product as prescribed by
Verification of system under multiple scenarios and with batteries from multiple vendors including recycled batteries
An investigation of climate/social impact including the effects of battery recycling
- A detailed economical analysis with required investment, payback time (ROI) for the end-consumer. The systems investments  and operational expenses will be compared to existing services for FCR-N provision from Svk´s perspective
-A full business model for flexibility services based on the results

Where: Örebro
When: 1/dec/2016 – 31/dec/2018
