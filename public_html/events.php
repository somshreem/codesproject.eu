<div class="col-sm-4"><p align="justify">Power2U aims to create a new actor, a Local System Operator (LSO), which designs and operates sustainable local energy systems in various customer segments (Commercial buildings, Industrial sites and Apartment buildings). </p></div>
<div class="col-sm-4"><p align="justify">The end-user's energy infrastructure is becoming more complex due to price reduction of energy technology, enabling customers to produce and store their own electricity. Hence the need and potential for a Local System Operator comes into play. </p></div>
<div class="col-sm-4"><p align="justify">Power2U aims to move from the traditional energy management approach to a more local, digital and renewable energy system and hence become an enabler for revolutionary changes in the energy market.</p></div>
